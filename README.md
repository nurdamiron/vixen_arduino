### Vixen Lights is a free and open-source software program designed for controlling Christmas lights and other types of holiday lighting displays. It allows users to create complex lighting sequences using a simple drag-and-drop interface, and can control a wide range of lighting hardware, including light controllers, dimmers, and DMX devices.

Vixen Lights was originally developed by Kevin "Gil" Gilbertson and released in 2009. Since then, it has become a popular tool for creating animated lighting displays, particularly for Christmas and other holiday displays.

The software is designed to be user-friendly and easy to learn, even for those with little to no experience in programming or lighting design. It offers a wide range of features, including the ability to synchronize music with lighting effects, support for a variety of file formats, and the ability to control multiple lighting channels simultaneously.
